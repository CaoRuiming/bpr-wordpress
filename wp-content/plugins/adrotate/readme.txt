== Description ==

With AdRotate you can easily place advertising banners pretty much anywhere on your site while managing everything from the easy to use dashboard. No fussing with your themes code if you don't want to.

Easily create your own adverts with basic HTML and/or Javascript code or use adverts from your favorite Ad Server such as Media.net, Blind Ferret, Yahoo! Adverts, DFP, Google AdSense, Google Ad Manager, Bing Ads, Amazon Affiliates, Chitika, Doubleclick, JuiceAds and many more similar ad servers and affiliate programs.

> With AdRotate you manage your promotional campaigns and banners with ease, all from your dashboard. 

With AdRotate it's easy to check up on how many impressions your adverts have. Monitor advert groups and see which are the most effective. Make the most of advertising with the many features AdRotate has to offer.

AdRotate looks and feels similar to the WordPress dashboard you already know, this means you're already familiar with AdRotate before you even start using the plugin. Familiarize yourself with the many useful features and you'll be up and running minutes.
