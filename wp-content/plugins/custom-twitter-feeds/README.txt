"***Great for Customization** - Great plugin! Superb customization options! Am changing all twitter feeds for all my websites to this! I have tried several Twitter plugins so far. This is the best I have come across :)*" - [@nehavivekpatil](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-for-customization-2/)

"***Excellent plug-in. Excellent support.** - Excellent instructions and guidance. Patient and prompt support for the newbies. Regular updates. You can't lose. Thank you Smash Balloon.* - [@nuspa](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plug-in-excellent-support-2/)

"***Amazing Support and a Great Twitter Plugin** - I am using the free version of this Twitter plugin and identified a real problem in the display on my website. I emailed support and Craig was all over the fix for me. Seven or so emails later (even on a Sunday) the problem was fixed and Craig was still reaching out to make sure all was well.*

*In a world of crappy support for premium plugins, and even worse support for free plugins, this kind of support (and listening to customers) that Craig and Smash Balloon provided me make their premium products worth every penny. In fact, I am going to buy them on my next project. They deserve it.*

*Thanks again, Craig!*" - [@kcwebguy](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/amazing-support-and-a-great-twitter-plugin/)

"***At last a configurable Twitter Feed that WORKS!** - I have messed with Twitter feeds on sites so many times only to be frustrated. This Plugin is the best I have tried. Stable, configurable and not too hefty a drag on performance. Well done!* - [@mikemac67](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/at-last-a-configurable-feed-that-works/)

"***Everything you'll need in a Twitter feed plugin** - We've tried a few Twitter feed plugins across a bunch of our sites, and this one is now our go-to favorite. Most of the others we've tried have either styling or performance issues, but we've been using this plugin for a few months now, and it's been perfect. There are tons of customization options, the feed looks great, and... it works!*

*Kudos to the SmashBalloon team on a well supported, tightly developed, feature-packed WordPress Plugin.* - [@laymanlab](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/everything-youll-need-in-a-twitter-feed-plugin/)

2. Activate the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the 'Twitter Feed' settings page to configure your Twitter feed.
4. Use the shortcode [custom-twitter-feeds] in your page, post or widget to display your Twitter feed.

For simple step-by-step directions on how to set up the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin please refer to our [setup guide](http://smashballoon.com/custom-twitter-feeds/free/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_campaign=ctf 'Custom Twitter Feeds setup guide').

= Setting up the Free Custom Twitter Feeds WordPress Plugin =

If you have an issue or question while setting up or using the plugin then please submit a support ticket and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

1) Once you've installed the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin click on the "Twitter Feeds" item in your WordPress menu

2) Click on the large blue Twitter login button to get your Twitter Access Token and Twitter Secret. Note; if you have your own Twitter Developer App set up then you can enter your Twitter information manually by enabling the checkbox below the Twitter login button.

3) Authorize the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin to read your Tweets.
Note; the plugin does not obtain permission to edit or write to your Twitter account, only to read your Twitter content.

4) Twitter sends back your Twitter Access Token and Twitter Secret which are then automatically saved by the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin. This information is required in order to connect to the Twitter API.

5) Enter a Twitter screenname to display Tweets from. Alternatively, choose to display Tweets from your Twitter home timeline or a Twitter hashtag.

6) Navigate to the Customize and Style pages to customize your Twitter feed.

7) Once you've customized your Twitter feed, click on the "Display Your Feed" tab for directions on how to display your Twitter feed (or multiple Twitter feeds).

8) Copy the [custom-twitter-feeds] shortcode and paste it into any page, post or widget where you want the Twitter feed to appear.

9) You can paste the [custom-twitter-feeds] shortcode directly into your page editor.

10) You can use the default WordPress 'Text' widget to display your Twitter Feed in a sidebar or other widget area.
 
11) View your website to see your Twitter feed(s) in all their glory!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple Twitter feeds on my site or on the same page? =

Yep. You can display multiple Twitter feeds by using our built-in shortcode options, for example: `[custom-twitter-feeds screenname="smashballoon" num=3]`. You can add it to any post, page, or widget, to easily display your Twitter feed in a beautiful Twitter widget.

= How do I embed the Twitter Feed directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your Twitter feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[custom-twitter-feeds]'); ?>`.

= Is the content of my Twitter feed crawlable by search engines and how does it help improve my SEO? =

Unlike other Twitter plugins which use iframes to embed your Twitter feed into your page in a widget, the Custom Twitter Feeds uses server-side code to embed your Twitter feed widget content directly into your page. This adds dynamic, search engine crawlable content to your site.

= Will Custom Twitter Feeds work with W3 Total Cache or other caching plugins? =

The Custom Twitter Feeds plugin should work in compatibility with most, if not all, caching plugins, but you may need to tweak the settings in order to allow the Twitter feed to update successfully and display your latest Twitter posts.  If you are experiencing problems with your Twitter feed widget not updating then try disabling either 'Page Caching' or 'Object Caching' in W3 Total Cache (or any other similar caching plugin) to see whether that fixes the problem and the Twitter feed displays and updates successfully.

= The font in my Twitter feed isn't inherited from my website =

Be default your Twitter feed should inherit the font from your website. If this isn't the case then it's possible that something in the theme is preventing this from happening. An issue that we've run into before is that &lt;code&gt; tags are added into the Twitter feed widget HTML by either the theme, another plugin, or perhaps even the custom-twitter-feeds shortcode being wrapped in code tags in your page editor. To fix this;

1) First – go to your page editor, click on the 'Text' tab in the top right of the editor box, and check whether the [custom-twitter-feeds] shortcode is being wrapped in &lt;code&gt; tags, like so: &lt;code&gt;[custom-twitter-feeds]&lt;/code&gt;. If it is, then remove them.

2) If this doesn't solve the problem then try adding the following to the plugin's "Custom CSS" section (Twitter Feeds > Customize > Custom CSS):

`#ctf code { font-family: sans-serif; }`

You can replace the font-family with whatever font your theme is using.

= Differences between the free version and Pro version of the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin =

The main differences between the free version and Pro version of the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin are listed below. The extra features available in the Pro version are as follows:

- Display photos, videos, and gifs in your Tweets, with support for 3rd party services such as YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, and SoundCloud
- View Twitter media in a pop-up lightbox directly on your site

- Display your Twitter feed in rotating Carousels / Slideshows

- Create advanced Twitter "Search" feeds or use the "Mentions" timeline
- Combine Twitter feeds of multiple types (i.e. User feeds and Hashtag Twitter feeds combined)
- Filter feeds by hashtag, word(s), or remove specific tweets
- Autoload more tweets when scrolling to the bottom of the Twitter feed

= I'm receiving an error message when trying to display my Twitter feed =

If you receive an error message when trying to display your Twitter Feed widget then you can use the error reference below to diagnose the issue and find the relevant solution.

**Twitter Error:**
Could not authenticate you

**Causes:**
- You may be using Twitter access tokens that are not valid - See #1 below
- You checked the box to enter your own Twitter app information, but one or more of the fields are incorrect - See #2 below

**Twitter Error:**
Invalid or expired token

**Causes:**
- You may not have entered your Twitter access tokens or they are not valid - See #1 below

**Twitter Error:**
Unable to load tweets (with no other explanation)

**Causes:**
- You may need to raise the number of tweets to retrieve and display in your Twitter feed widget - See #3 below

**Twitter Error:**
Sorry, that Twitter page does not exist

**Causes:**
- There may be a typo in the Twitter screen name or hashtag you are attempting to use

**Twitter Error:**
Over capacity

**Causes:**
- Twitter's servers are over capacity so the API is unusable. This will correct itself after some time.

**Twitter Error:**
Connection timed out after 10000 milliseconds

**Causes:**
- Most likely this is due to your server blocking access to the Twitter API – See #4 below

**Solutions**

**#1 - Your Twitter access tokens might not be valid**

The easiest way to verify this is by going back to the Settings page for the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin and clicking the big blue Twitter login button on the "Configure" tab to get new Twitter access tokens. If you haven't set up your own Twitter App, the only way to use the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin is to click the big blue button to get a Twitter access token and Twitter access token secret that is compatible with the default Twitter client used by Smash Balloon.

**#2 - You have checked the box to use your own Twitter app information but one or more of the fields are incorrect**

All four fields, Twitter consumer token, Twitter consumer secret, Twitter access token, and Twitter access token secret, need to come from the Twitter app that you set up on Twitter.com. Try returning to your personal Twitter app management page https://apps.twitter.com/ and confirming that all four fields, Twitter consumer token, Twitter consumer secret, Twitter access token, and Twitter access token secret are entered correctly in the corresponding fields on the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin's "Configure" tab.

**#3 - You may need to raise the number of tweets to retrieve**

Navigate to the type of Twitter feed you are trying to display on twitter.com. For example, if you are displaying a Twitter feed from the screenname "smashballoon", go to https://twitter.com/smashballoon. Make sure there are tweets visible. Then click on the link "Tweets & replies". If there are a more recent replies than original tweets, there may be too many tweets being filtered out to display any. Twitter replies are removed by default. You can raise the number of tweets to retrieve initially by going to the Custom Twitter Feed Settings page, "Customize" tab, and navigating to the "Advanced" area. Then raise the "Tweet Multiplier" and test to see if your Twitter feed now displays tweets.

If you're still having trouble displaying your Tweets after trying the common issues above then please [contact support](https://smashballoon.com/custom-twitter-feeds/support/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_campaign=ctf) for assistance.
