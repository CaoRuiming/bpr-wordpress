Write a myriad of WordPress events to syslog for integration with fail2ban.

== Description ==

[fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0) is one of the simplest and most effective security measures you can implement to prevent brute-force attacks.

*WP fail2ban* logs all login attempts - including via XML-RPC, whether successful or not, to syslog using LOG_AUTH. For example:

    Oct 17 20:59:54 foobar wordpress(www.example.com)[1234]: Authentication failure for admin from 192.168.0.1
    Oct 17 21:00:00 foobar wordpress(www.example.com)[2345]: Accepted password for admin from 192.168.0.1

*WPf2b* comes with three `fail2ban` filters: `wordpress-hard.conf`, `wordpress-soft.conf`, and `wordpress-extra.conf`. These are designed to allow a split between immediate banning (hard) and the traditional more graceful approach (soft), with extra rules for custom configurations.

= Features =

* **NEW - Multisite Support**
  Version 4.3 introduces [proper support for multisite networks](https://wp-fail2ban.com/features/multisite-networks/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0).

* **NEW - Block username logins**
  Sometimes it's not possible to block user enumeration (for example, if your theme provides Author profiles). Version 4.3 adds support for requiring the use of email addresses for login.

* **NEW - Filter for Empty Username Login Attempts**
  Some bots will try to login without a username. Version 4.3 logs these attempts and provides an "extra" filter to match them.

* **NEW - syslog Dashboard Widget**
  Ever wondered what's being logged? The new dashboard widget shows the last 5 messages; the Premium version keeps a full history to help you analyse and prevent attacks.

* **Remote Tools Add-on**
  The Remote Tools add-on provides extra features without adding bloat to the core plugin. For more details see the [add-on page](https://wp-fail2ban.com/add-ons/remote-tools/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0).

* **Support for 3rd-party Plugins**
  Version 4.2 introduced a simple API for authors to integrate their plugins with *WPf2b*, with 2 *experimental* add-ons:
  * [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fail2ban-addon-contact-form-7/)
  * [Gravity Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fail2ban-addon-gravity-forms/)

* **CloudFlare and Proxy Servers**
  *WPf2b* can be configured to work with [CloudFlare and other proxy servers](https://wp-fail2ban.com/features/cloudflare-and-proxy-servers/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0).

* **Comments**
  *WPf2b* can log comments (see [`WP_FAIL2BAN_LOG_COMMENTS`](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/defines.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#wp-fail2ban-log-comments)) and attempted comments (see [`WP_FAIL2BAN_LOG_COMMENTS_EXTRA`](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/defines.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#wp-fail2ban-log-comments-extra)).

* **Pingbacks**
  *WPf2b* logs failed pingbacks, and can log all pingbacks. For an overview see [`WP_FAIL2BAN_LOG_PINGBACKS`](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/defines.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#wp-fail2ban-log-pingbacks).

* **Spam**
  *WPf2b* can log comments marked as spam. See [`WP_FAIL2BAN_LOG_SPAM`](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/defines.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#wp-fail2ban-log-spam).

* **Block User Enumeration**
  *WPf2b* can [block user enumeration](https://wp-fail2ban.com/features/block-user-enumeration/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0).

* **Work-Arounds for Broken syslogd**
  *WPf2b* can be configured to work around most syslogd weirdness. For an overview see [`WP_FAIL2BAN_SYSLOG_SHORT_TAG`](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/defines.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#wp-fail2ban-syslog-short-tag) and [`WP_FAIL2BAN_HTTP_HOST`](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/defines.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#wp-fail2ban-http-host).

* **Blocking Users**
  *WPf2b* can be configured to short-cut the login process when the username matches a regex. For an overview see [`WP_FAIL2BAN_BLOCKED_USERS`](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/defines.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#wp-fail2ban-blocked-users).

* **`mu-plugins` Support**
  *WPf2b* can easily be configured as a must-use plugin - see [Configuration](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/4.3/configuration.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-4.3.0#mu-plugins-support).
